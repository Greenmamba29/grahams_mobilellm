## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 3. **ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION MISALIGNMENT** - Priority: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: `.env.example` shows document platform configs, missing LLM Answer Engine keys
- **Missing**: `SERPER_API`, `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY` in main `.env.example`
- **Risk**: Developer onboarding friction, deployment failures
- **Assigned**: Junior Dev

- **Action**:
  - [x] Update main `.env.example` to match WARP.md requirements (Added Groq, Serper, Brave Search APIs)
  - [ ] Audit docker-compose.yml environment section (Next phase)
  - [ ] Create environment setup validation script (Next phase)

### 4. **ARCHITECTURE HYBRID CONFUSION** - Priority: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- **Current**: Dashboard shows document upload/processing UI instead of conversational interface
- **Risk**: User experience confusion, development complexity
- **Assigned**: Senior Dev
- **Completed**: 2025-09-28
- **Action**:
  - [x] Design unified UX that presents LLM Answer Engine as primary interface
  - [x] Integrate document upload as enhancement to chat experience
  - [x] Refactor dashboard to conversation-centric with document context

### 5. **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT RISKS** - Priority: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Outdated AI SDK version (3.1.25), missing LangChain dependencies
- **Risk**: Feature incompatibility, security issues, performance degradation
- **Assigned**: Senior Dev
- **Completed**: 2025-09-28
- **Action**:
  - [x] Update `ai` package to latest stable (v5.0.56)
  - [x] Built custom RAG implementation without LangChain dependency
  - [x] Verify feature compatibility after updates (Build successful)

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 6. **ERROR HANDLING GAPS** - Priority: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across API routes and tools
- **Files Affected**: `app/tools/*`, `app/api/*`
- **Risk**: Poor user experience, debugging difficulties
- **Assigned**: Junior Dev
- **Due**: 2025-10-10
- **Action**:
  - [ ] Implement standardized error handling patterns
  - [ ] Add proper logging throughout application
  - [ ] Create error boundary components for UI

### 7. **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE MISSING** - Priority: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: No test runner or testing framework configured
- **Risk**: Regression bugs, deployment confidence issues
- **Assigned**: Senior Dev
- **Due**: 2025-10-15
- **Action**:
  - [ ] Set up Jest + React Testing Library
  - [ ] Write critical path tests for LLM interactions
  - [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

### 8. **RATE LIMITING & CACHING ENABLED** - Priority: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Production-critical features disabled in config
- **Config**: `useRateLimiting: true`, `useSemanticCache: true`
- **Risk**: API abuse, high costs, poor performance
- **Assigned**: DevOps + Senior Dev
- **Completed**: 2025-09-28
- **Action**:
  - [x] Enable rate limiting in config (Ready for Redis integration)
  - [x] Enable semantic caching in config (Ready for Redis integration)
  - [ ] Set up Upstash Redis for production (Next deployment phase)

## üîç LOW PRIORITY & TECHNICAL DEBT

### 9. **Prisma Database Integration Incomplete**
- Issue: Prisma configured but may not align with LLM Answer Engine needs
- Action: Audit database schema design for conversation history + document metadata

### 10. **Express API Separation**
- Issue: Dual architecture (Next.js + Express) increases maintenance overhead
- Action: Evaluate if Express API is necessary or can be consolidated

### 11. **Docker Configuration Outdated**
- Issue: Docker compose missing new environment variables
- Action: Update Docker configuration to match current requirements

### 12. **Function Calling in Beta**
- Issue: Core feature marked as beta with potential instability
- Action: Stabilize function calling system for production
